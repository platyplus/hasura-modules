  install: |
    This will install an auth schema, a public.users table as well as all the related Hasura metadata.
    Please check that no auth schema already exists.
    If a public.users table already exists, it will update it, create the required columns (id, created_at, updated_at, display_name, avatar), and use id as a primarey key.
  uninstall: |
    Uninstalling the Hasura Backend Plus will fully remove the auth schema, but will keep the public.users table intact.

    You must now install and configure the Hasura Backend Plus service.
